        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589â€“618 CE) in China.
         The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two things: its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice to eat in one sitting.
